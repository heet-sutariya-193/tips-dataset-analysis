Python Problem Statement
Perform following tasks on tips dataset. Also generate three statements form your side,

to draw heatmap
histogram/stackplot/scatter plot

Remove any duplicate and drop any column but on copied dataset. Do not change the original one.

Using seaborn examine the linear relationship between tips and total_bill across different dimensions to answer the following:

Do smoker/non-smoker give a higher tip as a percentage of total_bill (which line has a steeper slope)

Are tips larger during lunch or dinner (as a percentage of total_bill)

Does the gender that tips the most (as a percentage of total_bill) change between lunch and dinner?

Answer the question by visual examination of lmplot output

Use global and groupby aggregates to answer the following questions

What is the average tip amount

What is the average bill amount

What is the average tip by gender

What is the average tip on a sunday by gender

Which party size gives the maximum tip as a percent of total bill amount

Generate a box plot that shows average bill amount by day of week

Generate a box plot that shows average bill amount by gender

Show the above two plots side by side

Generate the same plots using matplotlib
